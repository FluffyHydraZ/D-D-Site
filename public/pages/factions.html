        <ul>
            <li><h2>Heroes Guild</h2></li>
                <p>After the barriers went down all across the land. The heroes guild was formed to defend the civilian population from the wide variety of monsters that roam the lands.</p>
                <p>The Heroes Guild also takes in prospecting heroes if they can prove themselves. After they join they are trained and given missions equal in difficulty to what the Guildmaster thinks they can handle.</p>
            <li><h2>Pirates</h2></li>
                <p>Well not an offical faction. It is more a collective of like minded indiviudals. Pirates and privateers gather at special ports designed to accomidate their more nefarious pourposes.</p>
            <li><h2>The Hellfire Society</h2></li>
                <p>Once a relativley small group, of exclusivley tieflings, that sold discounted magic items. Aftet the destruction of ____, they became nearly the only proveyer of magic goods. Taking advantage of this they gained influnce in just about every part of the world.</p>
                <p>Many rumors surround the tight knit Hellfire Society. Perhaps its just becuase no one from the outside can get any informaion on them, or perhaps some of the rumors are true... </p>
